          <h1>Introduction</h1>
          <p>Introduction to Domain Specific Languages</p>
          <p>
            DSLs are popular for two main reasons:
            <ul>
              <li>Improving productivity for developers in the specified domain</li>
              <li>Improving communication between developers and domain experts</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            Using appropriate DSLs will make it easier to process and understand a complicated block of code, thus improving the productivity for those who work with it. DSLs will often use terms that are hugely related to the specific domain. This makes it easier to communicate with domain experts, as code blocks are now more descriptive using domain-specific terms that domain experts can understand.
          </p>
          <p>
            To show the difference between DSLs and General Programming Languages (GPL), we can compare the capabilities/computational power of those two types of languages. In terms of computational ability, we can say in general that DSLs are a subset of GPLs. To give further backing to this statement, we have to bring in the concept of Turing Completeness.
          </p>
          <h1>Turing Completeness and DSLs</h1>
          <p>
            Formally in the context of programming languages, we say that a language is Turing Complete if it can be used to simulate any Turing Machine. What that means in practical terms is that given any computer algorithm, a Turing Complete language can be used to construct a machine that is capable of simulating the algorithm. Knowing that something is Turing Complete actually has impactful implications. It implies that EVERY plausible design for a computing device, no matter how advanced, can be emulated using a Turing Machine. This claim is sometimes referred to as the Church-Turing thesis.
          </p>
          <p>
            In contrast to GPLs which are mostly Turing Complete, DSLs are mostly <b>NOT</b> Turing Complete. This stems from the fact that DSLs do not need to be Turing Complete to serve its main purpose of supporting domain-specific tasks. As such, designers of DSLs do not prioritise Turing Completeness as a goal when creating the language. And for good reason as well! Turing Completeness is a feature that particularly concerns General Programming Languages. This is because of the added flexibility it gives to the general users, whose tasks span a wide range. While the ability to simulate any logic flow may sound nice, it may not be of a particular focus when designing Domain Specific Languages. In particular, the purpose of a DSL is to support the possible logic flows that stem from a specific domain. Implementing various excess features to make a language Turing Complete may introduce potential pitfalls and add verbosity without contributing much to its main purpose.
          </p>
          <h1>Turing Completeness and Regular Expressions</h1>
          <p>
            To exemplify how Turing Completeness might prove to introduce more hindrance than convenience, we must first revisit in detail some of the implicatons of being Turing Complete. In this case, we will need to know about the Halting Problem. The Halting Problem is the problem of determining whether a program will eventually finish running or continue to run forever. In 1936, Alan Turing proved that it is impossible to solve the Halting Problem for Turing Machines. This means that it is impossible to predict computationally whether a Turing Machine will terminate (halt) once it runs. The following example will give a concrete example on why this property may not be desirable in DSLs.
          </p>
          <p>
             Now, going to the specific task of matching strings, users should always expect a match result when given a search pattern. However, if the DSL used to match strings is Turing Complete, it implies the Halting Problem as mentioned above. As such, Turing Completeness of a DSL might cause it to deviate from its original purpose.
           </p>
           <h1>Turing Completeness and MATLAB</h1>
           <p>
            Although most domain specific languages end up being not Turing-Complete, there are some domain specific languages which were not designed with the intention of being Turing Complete, but ended up being so either ways. One prime example would be MATLAB. 
          </p>
          <p>
            MATLAB, short for Matrix Laboratory, was originally designed by Computer Science professors who wanted to make matrix computations easier, by removing the need for their students to write more complex Fortran programs to perform computations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Aimed towards performing mathematical operations on matrices, MATLABâ€™s scripting environment seemed to be more functional in nature, where the primary goal was to program a declaration that evaluates a mathematical function, in this case a matrix operation. However, with the recent breakthroughs in fields such as image processing , along with the gradual paradigm shift towards a more Object-Oriented approach, linear algebra problems in the aforementioned fields have also become much more complex and often require the implementation of control flow and the use of variables and objects to improve readability, both of which are conditions of being Turing Complete.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore, MATLAB, while being designed specifically to make solving linear algebra easier, can also be used to solve any computation in the world. That being said, this only implies that MATLAB can be used as a general programming language. Whether or not you decide that MATLAB is a good general programming language is a completely different question for another day.
          </p>

           <h1>What Next</h1>
           <p>
             On this website, we aim to allow you to familiarise yourselves with popular DSLs. This is to allow you to get an idea of how DSLs are implemented and used in real-world context. With that in mind, we chose 3 of the most common DSLs used by programmers of all levels: Regular Expressions (regex), Matrix Laboratory (MATLAB) and Structured Query Language (SQL). Below, you can find short summaries on their respective articles.
           </p>

             <p>
               In this article, we aim to get readers involved in implementing their own regexes. This is done through a straight-forward tutorial on the rules coupled with clear examples. This tutorial assumes no prior programming experience, particularly due to the specificity of its features to the domain of pattern matching.
